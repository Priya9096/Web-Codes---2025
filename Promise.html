<!--
1.Promises are used to handle asynchronous Tasks.
2.Asynchronous tasks are such tasks where next instruction
wont wait for previous instruction to complete rather
all tasks will be executed parallely.
3.Promises has 3 states(Pending, resolved, rejected)
4.If Promise is under resolve state then then() will be called.
5.If Promise is under reject state then catch() will be
called.
